    <!-- What do you think a functional website looks like? With good SEO and easy to find on Google:
     - it is up to date (if there is anything to update) and has blog articles to get the site rolling
    - clear, with appropriate headings (h1/h2/h3 - unique titles up to 20-70 characters) and structure, good UX/UI
    - fast, with optimized code and images + alt tags for images
    - it talks specifically about services - valuable content
    - mobile friendly first!
    - it is worth using CDNs such as fontawesome to load content quickly on the website - or simply buy a better server that uses CDN such as Cloudflare
    - website links should be short, divided into categories, up to 2000 characters, without -, _ and capital letters, e.g.: https://www.warsztatwww.pl/about-us
    - SSL certificate must be installed!
    - add links to our pages on other subpages
    - sitemap to GSC for large pages - and robots.txt also as an optional addition if we want to restrict bot access to certain subpages 0 - you can also add the meta tag “robots”: “noindex, nofollow”
    - take care of the 404 page and redirects and add them to the .htaccess file -->
